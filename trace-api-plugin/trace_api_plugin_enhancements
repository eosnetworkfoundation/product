# Trace API Plugin enhancements

## ABI Support

Currently `trace_api_plugin` only supports decoding `action` and `return_value` data via command line provided `trace-rpc-abi` files. This requires manually 
providing new ABI file any time the ABI changes.
Add using on-chain ABI at time of action execution for decoding of the `action` and `return_value` data.
Provide option to not track ABI if user does not require data expanded via ABI. ABI decoding should be the default.

## Index transactions by transaction id for quicker retrieval.

Currently `trace_api_plugin` does a sequential scan for `/v1/trace_api/get_transaction_trace`. Add an index for faster lookup.

## Investigate removing `fsync`

We do not use `fsync` for other file writing. Determine if `fflush` is sufficient.

## Use SQLite for storage

Usage would simplify the index on transaction issue and provide easier storage/lookup of ABI. Also solves the `fsync` question.
