# Performance Testing Harness Delivery Staging

Phased roadmap for the development of a **Performance Testing Harness**.

Requirements are being curated for the development of a performance testing and evaluation harness here: [Performance Testing Harness Requirements](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/product/tree/main/performance-harness/proposals)



## MVP


### Transaction Source

-   Transaction generator
    -   minimal
    -   most likely just transfers
    -   p2p format using net plugin
    -   configurable
        -   Token transfers per second (tps) for generating
        -   number of threads
    -   tracks generation rate
        -   exit on poor performance
        -   report if Source or Provider is at fault
-   Transaction Provider
    -   establishes p2p connection to net_plugin
    -   configurable
        -   number of connections (to the same nodeos)
        -   configurable number of threads

### Run Harness

-   python script
    -   setup environment
    -   launch nodeos node(s)
    -   run Transaction Sources
    -   end test
    -   run output evaluation
    -   Create CSV results for ingestion in the future

### Output Evaluation

-   python script
    -   capture of logs
    -   scrape nodeos logs
    -   evaluate
        -   min
        -   max
        -   standard deviation
    -   Reporting of configurations and run env to CSV report
        -   Nodeos version, configuration options, env, etc
    -   TPS Scoring
        -   Standard deviation, mean, average (basic stats)

### User Documentation & Testing & Baseline Evaluation

-   How to:
    -   setup
    -   run the performance harness tests
    -   gather results
    -   access/intepret results
    -   describe what is available

## Phase 2


### Expand Transaction generator

-   configurable
    -   number of accounts

### Expand MVP to support multi-producer setup

-   Coordinate TPS generation across multi-nodes
-   Possibly multiple generators across nodes

### Include configurable "relay" nodes

-   Specific configuration per node type

### Expand reporting to include multiple nodes

-   Number of Forks
-   Number of dropped blocks
    -   Missed blocks
    -   Forked blocks
-   Number of dropped transactions
-   Number of complete windows

### Begin Design Planning for migration to auto deployment

-   Building architectural/design doc
-   Evaluation of technologies
-   Recommendation for technologies to use

## Phase 3


### HTTP harness testing

-   Setup HTTP performance testing across single node

### Additional contract type

-   EOS mechanics

### Migrate from manual cli deployment to auto deployment

-   Use of Ansible and Terraform or similar
-   Provide barebones "gui" for changing configuration

### Increase output evaluation statistics

-   Graphical representation of results
-   Plotting of latency and other stats

### Storage of historical data for comparison

-   Availability of data from web
-   Github pages? GCP?


## Additional Planned Development (To prioritize and work into later phases)

-   Cloud infrastructure support
    -   Ease of deployment/teardown
    -   Ease of scaling
    -   Pinned environment support
-   Reporting
    -   Additional charts/histograms
    -   Support multiple output formats
-   Multi & Single Node Testing improvements
    -   Increase available testing configurations
    -   Increase the usability of configuration
    -   Artificial network latency
    -   Improve Transaction Generation capabilities
    -   Performance monitoring/comparison with feature releases
    -   Increase Contract Action coverage
    -   Increase Contract Testing scenarios
    -   Coverage of running on different states
    -   Replay performance testing
    -   Increase testing/measuring for stability
-   Metrics
    -   Continue to improve metrics collected and reported on
    -   Build historical metric comparison
-   Administration Portal
    -   configure Performance Test Harness
    -   run performance test harness
    -   run pinned configurations
    -   UI/UX design
