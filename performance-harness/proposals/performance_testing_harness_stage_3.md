# Performance Testing Harness Stage 3 Planning

Roadmap for the development of a **Performance Testing Harness** -- Stage 3.

Requirements are being curated for the development of a performance testing and evaluation harness here: [Performance Testing Harness Requirements & Planning & Staging](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/product/tree/main/performance-harness/proposals)


## Stage 3

### Work with ENF to identify additional metrics that would be useful to publish (Carried over from Stage 2)
    -   Support additional metrics that would be useful to publish

### Additional Latency Measuremeants

-   Measure latency:
    -   From creation
    -   From consumption in nodeos
    -   From consumption from SHiP
    -   From consumption from trace_api_plugin

### Engage with ENF to plot course on the following topics

-   Engage with ENF to identify:
    -   Individuals at ENF to engage with
    -   How to gather and persist data
    -   What data to gather and persist
    -   How to incoporate Performance Harness into CI/CD
    -   Initial control surface (simple UI?)
    -   Visualizations desired (tool/technology, graphs, etc.)
