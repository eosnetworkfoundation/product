# Proposal to provide a test suite to ensure that compatibility with tooling that depends on DMLOG

## Problem
Important community tools depend on DMLOG messages, but there is no test suite to ensure continuous compatibility as changes/new
releases are made for Leap. Specifically to ensure that DMLOG is working in Leap, and that what/how it logs hasn't changed in a
breaking way.

## Opportunity
Protect compatibility with critical 3rd party tools with a test suite around DMLOG and it's instrumentation in Leap.

The "Battlefield" repo originally written by the dfuse team, and now hosted by EOS Nation can serve as an example of the kinds of tests
that would be valuable to include. [Battlefield EOSIO](https://github.com/EOS-Nation/battlefield-eosio/)

## Target Audience
3rd Party Community Tools, and the developers that depend on them.

There are many important community tools that depend on DMLOG messages as critical functionality. Categorical examples include:

- legacy firehose/dfuse
- new firehose/substreams
- "dfuse light" gaming sdk

Examples of specific solutions that depend on DMLOG messages include:

- legacy dfuse/firehose (EOS Nation)
- new firehose/substreams (EOS Nation)
- Hypha DAO via firehose (Hypha DAO)
- Antelope IBC via firehose (UX/Titan)
- Zeus DAPP SDK via firehose (LiquidApps aka @natpd)
- dfuse light gaming sdk directly reading DMLOG (Liquiid aka @cmadh)

## Strategic Alignment
This proposal indirectly contributes to making DAPP development easier on EOS and Antelope based chains. The tools that depend on
DMLOG and the related instrumentation make it easier for developers to produce applications that need fast, convnient, and reliable
access to blockchain state history.

## Success Definition
A test suite that runs quickly with a high degree of coverage for the DMLOG messages that dfuse/dfuse-light/firehose/substreams
implementations depend on.
